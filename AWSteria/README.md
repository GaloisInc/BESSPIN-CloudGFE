This directory contains Nikhil's setup for supporting a version of the GFE on AWS-FPGA.

This is a possible alternative to:

- Jamey Hick's approach, based on Connectal
- Firesim approach (Berkeley, Chisel, ...)

This approach builds bottom-up from some of the AWS supplied examples,
keeping their flow, and minimally modifying their example files, etc.,
so as not to rely on any additional tooling.
